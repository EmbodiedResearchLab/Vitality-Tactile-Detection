## EEG_Master_Script.m
Run this script for the EEG & Tactile Detection Task, which includes:

1. Dipole Creation (6 mins.)
2. Training Blocks (2.5 mins)
3. PEST Convergence Procedure (3 mins.)
4. Tactile Detection Task (20 mins.)

## Experimenter Inputs
To run the experiment, type the "EEG_Master_Script.m" into the MATLAB command window.  It will ask for the Participant ID number and for pre- or post- meditation training.  If this study is cross-sectional, simply type 0 when prompted for training.  This saves data into allocated folders at the conclusion of the experiment.

## Experiment Setup
* Include a diagram of the final setup.

1. Plug auxiliary cord into computer used for experiment.
2. RCA end of cable should be plugged into a RCA-BNC adapter.  This should be found either at the end of the cable or attached to an amplifier.
3. Plug the BNC end of the adapter into the amplifier (smaller black box) at the end labeled “Input”.
4. Plug the BNC cable from the amplifier at the end labeled “Output” to the tactile stimulator.
5. Connect the computer being used to a 2nd monitor.
6. Connect the number pad to the computer via USB port.
7. Plug power adapter into wall outlet.  Plug other end into the amplifier. (You might hear a hissing sound from the stimulator at this point.)
8. Make sure that computer volume is all the way up before starting the experiment.
9. [optional] You can sound check by playing music through the stimulator.  If all of the connections are right, you should the song you’re playing.
