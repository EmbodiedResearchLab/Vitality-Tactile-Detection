## EEG_Master_Script.m
Run this script for the EEG & Tactile Detection Task, which includes:

1. Dipole Creation (6 mins.)
2. Training Blocks (2.5 mins)
3. PEST Convergence Procedure (3 mins.)
4. Tactile Detection Task (20 mins.)

## Experimenter Inputs
To run the experiment, type the "EEG_Master_Script.m" into the MATLAB command window.  It will ask for the Participant ID number and for pre- or post- meditation training.  If this study is cross-sectional, type 0 when prompted for training.  This saves data into allocated folders at the conclusion of the experiment.
